Basic Idea of My Dataset
My dataset appears to be a customer churn dataset from a telecom company. It contains details about customers, such as their call usage (day, evening, and international minutes), charges, customer service calls, and whether they have an international or voicemail plan. The main goal of this dataset is to identify patterns in customer behavior that influence churn (i.e., whether a customer leaves the company).

Effectiveness of Different Analyses Used Throughout the Semester
During the semester, I explored multiple machine learning techniques. Below is a comparison of some of the key methods and their effectiveness for my dataset:

Supervised Learning (Classification Models)

Logistic Regression & Decision Trees: Used for predicting churn, but decision trees tend to overfit without pruning.
Random Forest: Effective because it reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.
Effectiveness for My Dataset: High, since I have a labeled target variable (Churn?) that I can predict.
Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

K-Means Clustering: Used in this analysis to group similar customers based on their call usage and service interactions.
Effectiveness for My Dataset: Moderate, as clustering helps in customer segmentation but may not directly predict churn.
Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Used to visualize high-dimensional data and improve clustering performance.
Effectiveness for My Dataset: Useful in visualization but not directly impactful on predictive performance.
Most Effective Approach for My Dataset
For my dataset, Supervised Learning (Classification) using models like Random Forest would be the most effective, as it directly predicts churn probability and provides insights into feature importance. Clustering (K-Means) was useful for customer segmentation but does not directly help in predicting churn. If my goal is to reduce churn, classification models would provide the best actionable insights.
